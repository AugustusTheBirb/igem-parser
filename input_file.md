# Introduction

In science, communication is never one-sided—it thrives on the exchange of ideas and opinions. This year, our team prioritized dialogue and interaction in our educational initiatives by collecting feedback and engaging with a diverse range of communities, from curious children to unexpected audiences, such as inmates. To steer our efforts, we created **BRIDGE**—a framework that reflects the core values education in synthetic biology and science should uphold:

**B – Building Understanding:** Making complex concepts accessible.  
**R – Real-World Relevance:** Demonstrating how (synthetic) biology impacts everyday life.  
**I – Inclusivity & Accessibility:** Ensuring that everyone, regardless of their background, could engage with science.  
**D – Dialogue & Engagement:** Encouraging discussion and collaborative learning.  
**G – Growth & Lifelong Learning:** Inspiring continued curiosity.  
**E – Education for Impact:** Fostering continuity and lasting change.

Through this framework, we promoted participation in various forms, including hands-on workshops, thought-provoking lectures and debates, scavenger hunts, hikes, quizzes, and interactive discussions. Each activity was designed not only to share knowledge but to start conversations and spark curiosity, making education an ongoing journey rather than a single event.

# The Life Trilogy: A Three-Part Experience

In our commitment to public education, we organized **The Life Trilogy**: a three-part series of events inviting diverse audiences to explore biology not only as a science, but also as a lens for understanding themselves and the world. By blending discussion, sensory experiences, and thought-provoking lectures, The Life Trilogy encouraged people from all backgrounds to engage with fundamental questions central to our mission: **how biology shapes identity, perception, and daily life.**

## GENESIS: Biology, DNA & Identity – What Lies Within?

Our first event, **GENESIS: Biology, DNA & Identity – What Lies Within?**, explored the impact of genetics on human personality and questioned the extent to which DNA determines identity.

We hosted an open discussion led by **Dr. Rolandas Meškys** and moderated by our team. Attendees critically considered both the power and limitations of DNA in shaping individuality. The event challenged misconceptions—for instance, that personality is entirely dictated by genes—while explaining how environment, trauma, and personal experience, alongside genetics, influence it.

However, the discussion wasn’t the only activity. We also set up stations, inviting participants to unique experiences blending self-observation, creativity, and interaction. The journey began at the first station, *‘**Among Sounds**’.* Here*,* music served as a bridge to the inner world, expressing emotions that words often could not. Participants listened to melodies and chose colors reflecting the feelings evoked, then visualized their state of mind and attached these to the ‘sound wall.’  In *‘**The Room of Reflections**’*, participants met themselves through fragments of mirrors, observing their reflections without judgment or explanation, simply noticing bodily sensations, eyes, and breath. *‘**The Neuron Bride**’* celebrated the joy of connection: participants drew questions, posed them to strangers, and symbolized new bonds by weaving strings into a web of connection, creating a visual representation of interpersonal links. With *‘**Feel the Film**’*, participants were invited to explore how sound affects perception by watching the same film scene with different audio tracks, revealing shifts in bodily reactions and interpretations. At *‘**The Identity Archive**’,* attendees released limiting traits, truths, or labels that held them back by depositing them in an archive container, symbolically letting them go. The final station, *‘**Reflection Corner**’*, *fostered an* intuitive connection: participants selected a question from the wall, responded with a single word, and added it to a collective field of responses, forming a bridge between personal experience and shared reflection.

By presenting biology as both a technical subject and a human story, **GENESIS** connected synthetic biology to real-life questions about identity and ethics. The event deepened participants' understanding of how science relates to individual lives, supporting our goal to make molecular biology approachable, relevant, and socially responsible.

## ESSENCE: The Alchemy of Sense

**ESSENCE**, the second event in our Life Trilogy series, explored how biology influences our experience of the world. While **GENESIS** investigated the hidden code of DNA, **ESSENCE** provided participants with direct contact with the molecular mechanics of the senses.

Before inviting the audience to experience their sensory systems in action, we began the event with an overview of human sensory biology and the evolution of taste and smell. We followed with a discussion on how these aspects can be complemented or modified by synthetic biology. After the introduction, we guided our guests to participate in the sense-bending activities.

**Taste manipulation**: Attendees sampled foods while certain senses were blocked or altered—such as tasting with eyes closed, with a pinched nose, or after changing the sensitivity of taste buds. They also tasted identical yogurts presented in different colors, discovering that many perceived different flavors purely due to the influence of sight and their own expectations. This demonstration highlighted the strong interplay between senses, emphasizing the significant role of smell, sight, and anticipation in flavor perception.

**Smell identification**: Participants used scented markers to guess hidden smells, sparking discussion about the complexity of olfactory receptors and the personal, subjective aspects of sensory experiences.

Through interactive activities, we enabled participants to discover the ‘alchemy’ of sensory biology in an enjoyable and lasting way, emphasizing how perception is influenced not only by our DNA-encoded receptors but also by context and environment.

**ESSENCE** transformed biology into an accessible and hands-on experience. The practical experiments provided valuable insights into the fundamental role of the senses and how personal views can influence perception. Participants left with a richer understanding of how molecules, context, and their own opinions interconnect—moving us forward in our mission to make science approachable and meaningful for everyone.

## BEYOND: Reimagining Perception

As the final installment of our event series, **BEYOND: Reimagining Perception** invited participants to explore the biological foundations of consciousness and altered mental states. The event was held at the fascinating **Automobile Museum**. The choice of venue was intentional: the museum’s exhibition on the evolution of automobiles offered an opportunity for a parallel to the integration of synthetic biology in the automotive industry. Participants were also invited to see the former Vilnius taxi park, a building whose two spiral structures are reminiscent of DNA helices. After exploring the environment, attendees gathered for lectures that encouraged them to think about the intersections of biology, perception, emotion, and microbes.

Two main talks were featured:

- In **“The Biochemistry of Consciousness: What Causes Dreams and Visions?”** Dr. Ramunė Dirvanskienė examined the molecular and neural bases for dreams, hallucinations, and shifts in perception  
- Dr. Rūta Kananavičiūtė’s **“Bacteria That Shape Our Mood and Mind”** explored how the microbiome affects neurotransmitters, emotions, and thought patterns, emphasizing the hidden interaction between our microbes and the brain.

Hosting these discussions outside traditional scientific settings reinforced the idea that biology transcends the laboratory, intersecting with culture, art, and imagination. Participants were encouraged to reflect on perception itself: **To what extent does internal biology shape our reality, and to what degree do external context and culture influence it?**

Concluding the Life Trilogy, **BEYOND** left the audience with a renewed sense of wonder and curiosity about the living systems within and around them, as well as a new curiosity about the boundaries of biology, identity, and experience.

## Reflection

The three parts of The Life Trilogy form a cohesive narrative arc — from **DNA and identity** to **sensory experience**, **consciousness**, **and perception**. Through interactive and accessible formats, we expanded our reach beyond the laboratory, making synthetic biology and related sciences approachable, relevant, and thought-provoking. This event series not only educated our audience but also deepened our own understanding of how science can be creatively and meaningfully communicated.

# Project-Related Education

In addition to our broader educational initiatives, we focused on ***Ixodes ricinus***, **the central figure of our project.** Through engaging activities, we aimed to raise awareness about ticks and tick-borne diseases while **providing participants with practical knowledge to apply in their daily lives.**

**IXPOSE the Threat** guided participants through a series of educational stations, each revealing a different aspect of the tick issue. The journey began by challenging myths and clarifying facts about ticks, breaking down common misconceptions. Another highlighted prevention, demonstrating how appropriate clothing choices can reduce exposure risk. Participants also received a step-by-step guide for safe tick removal and learned that prompt action is crucial. The program concluded with an insightful talk by immunologist **Prof. Aurelija Žvirblienė** on vaccine development for tick-borne diseases, followed by an overview of our project and its scientific goals.

During the **(De)code Nature** event, we organized a hike where the natural environment became an outdoor classroom. **Dr. Vilmantas Pupkis** and **Dr. Miglė Tomkuvienė** shared their expertise and answered questions live. By combining scientific discussion with direct engagement with nature, we enabled participants to connect abstract biological concepts to the environment they inhabit, emphasizing both the dangers of ticks and the importance of biodiversity.

# Education for the General Public

## **Hike with Neakivaizdinis Vilnius**

To celebrate the start of the new academic year, we partnered with *Neakivaizdinis Vilnius* to create a themed walking route, ‘**From Biological Cells to Vilnius: The Secret of the Code of Life***’*. This walk was designed to demonstrate that science is not limited to laboratories or textbooks—it is deeply integrated into the city’s history, art, and daily life. Along the route, participants visited familiar places, such as the Life Sciences Center, as well as unexpected stops, including the Lithuanian hounds sculpture, sparking conversations about genetics, heritage, and the preservation of traits. By combining nature, science, and culture, the walk inspired curiosity and creativity, encouraging everyone to view Vilnius as a living classroom. For us, this initiative brought synthetic biology closer to the public and sparked conversations that reached well beyond our university’s walls. The route is available [here](https://neakivaizdinisvilnius.lt/en/studies/from-biological-cells-to-vilnius/).

## **Mink Mitą: Continuing the Conversation**

This year, we proudly continued the **‘Challenge the Myth**’ (**„Mink Mitą“)** collaboration with **Radio Vilnius**, initially launched by last year’s Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM team. The podcast aims to reach a broader audience, break down complex scientific concepts, and inspire people to view science as an integral part of everyday life.

In 2024, **Fausta Michnevičiūtė** established and led the initiative.

Our partnership with **Radio Vilnius** is particularly significant, as it marks the station’s first-ever scientific broadcast, connecting a vibrant community of over 10,000 listeners.

What makes **Mink Mitą** unique is its blend of accessibility and depth. Each biweekly episode explores a scientific theme through real-world connections and engaging discussions, making topics such as fermentation, probiotics, and even astrobiology accessible to a broad audience. All episodes are archived and available on demand, creating a lasting repository of Lithuanian science communication.

[**Osvaldas Rukšėnas**](https://radiovilnius.live/neuronu-keliais-ir-hormonu-vingiais-su-neurobiologu-dr-osvaldu-ruksenu/)  
In our first episode, we interviewed **Prof. Osvaldas Rukšėnas**, a neurobiologist at Vilnius University, to delve into the complexities of the human brain. We discussed how genes, hormones, environment, and experience influence brain function, and explored the concept of neuroplasticity at different life stages. Our conversation also addressed the roles of hormones in learning, memory, and risk-taking, and examined how cultural stereotypes can shape our interpretation of biology. Through these discussions, we highlighted how neuroscience helps us understand both the remarkable flexibility and the natural boundaries of our minds.

[**Radvilė Rimgaile-Voicik**](https://radiovilnius.live/saknu-ir-ziedu-keliais-su-dr-radvile-rimgaile-voicik/)  
The second episode featured **Dr. Radvilė Rimgaile-Voicik**, discussing the often-overlooked world of plants. We explored how modern technologies, such as genome sequencing and AI, are revolutionizing our understanding of plant interactions, adaptation, and even memory-like behaviors. The discussion also explored the cultural and personal dimensions of botany—how reconnecting with plants can alleviate stress, shifting Lithuanian views on nature, and the untapped potential of plants in fields ranging from climate resilience to environmental monitoring.

[**Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM 2025 team**](https://radiovilnius.live/nuo-ideju-iki-mokslo-atradimu-su-vilnius-lithuania-igem-2025/)  
In the third episode, we turned the spotlight on our own team — Team and Human Practices Lead **Areta Petrauskaitė** and Lab Lead **Povilas Kruopis** — to give listeners an inside look at the Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM team. They discussed the team’s structure, division of tasks between lab work, communication, and outreach, as well as Lithuania’s proud decade-long participation in iGEM. We introduced **IXPOSE**, our innovative tool for detecting tick-borne pathogens, simplifying the TIGR-Tas system for public understanding, and underlining its importance for public health. The episode also covered daily lab life, the ups and downs of preparing for Paris, and stressed the roles of education, sponsors, and community support. In closing, Areta and Povilas reflected on their personal growth and shared hopes for future iGEM generations.

With **Mink Mitą**, we continue the legacy of past iGEM team efforts, strengthening the link between synthetic biology, public engagement, and Vilnius’ cultural life. Our podcast has become a platform where curiosity flourishes, myths are debunked, and science becomes an integral part of every listener's life.

## **Heritage Days at the Sapiega Palace**

During Sapiega Place Heritage Days, we had the fantastic opportunity to host a discussion on the artistic perspective of science, the creation and modification of microorganisms, and their role in restoration technologies. Panelists included artist and Sapiega Palace restoration specialist **Domas Noreika**; **Renata Gudiukaitė**, professor and head of the Department of Microbiology and Biotechnology at Life Sciences Centre of Vilnius University; **Eglė Lastauskienė**, microbiologist, professor, director of the Institute of Biosciences, and headwoman of the Senate at Vilnius University; **Rimantas Daugelavičius**, biochemist, professor, and head of the Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology of the Faculty of Natural Sciences at Vytautas Magnus University. The conversation highlighted not only the contributions of science to cultural preservation but also how artistic viewpoints can enrich society's engagement with biotechnology.

## **Comic Con Baltics 2025**

At Comic Con Baltics, we aimed to show that science is an integral part of pop culture, evident in games, cinema, and other art forms. Our booth combined hands-on activities and playful challenges that encouraged visitors to explore biology in unexpected ways, such as examining leaves under a microscope or learning about brain functions.

We created several interactive games to spark curiosity and interest. In **‘Guess the Invention’**, participants guessed invention dates of everyday innovations like antibiotics or in vitro fertilization. **‘Bacteria Tinder'** challenged visitors to pair bacteria with their natural habitats, presented through humorous, dating-profile-style descriptions. Finally, a QR-code scavenger hunt invited participants to collect cards, unlocking prizes and revealing fun facts about bacteria along the way.

By blending entertainment and education, we offered a meaningful engagement experience, giving Comic Con attendees the chance to interact directly with the principles of synthetic biology. Our goal was to demonstrate that science can be both approachable and enjoyable.

## **Scientific Quizzes**

One of our more lighthearted yet surprisingly engaging activities was designing playful, biology-themed personality quizzes. Participants could find out ‘**what type of bacteria they are**’*,* ‘**which gene matches their vibe***’*, or even **which enzyme or virus best represents them**. While these quizzes initially seemed like simple entertainment, they served a deeper purpose: making biology more approachable for those who might otherwise find it intimidating. By connecting complex scientific concepts to personal identity and humor, the activity sparked curiosity and encouraged participants to learn about biology in a relaxed and engaging manner. These creative associations made the material more memorable for our audience.

# Educational Activities for Pupils

## **Students for Pupils, Pupils for Students Initiative**

One of our earliest educational activities was participating in the Students for Pupils, Pupils for Students initiative—a three-day camp for high school students interested in exploring university opportunities. We joined to connect with young people as they shape their academic identities and explore many possibilities. Through interactive problem-solving activities and discussions, we aimed to make science approachable and engaging. Pupils were encouraged to identify real-world problems that concerned them and propose creative solutions to address these issues. Rather than demanding technical explanations, we encouraged them to connect their ideas with current or emerging concepts in synthetic biology. Many of their proposals, even those that were rough or idealistic, reflected genuine research trends in the field, showing their solutions were more aligned with reality than they might have thought. This experience also allowed us to listen closely and learn what excites or confuses students about life sciences, helping us refine our communication and inspiration strategies for the next generation of researchers.

## **International Conference The Coins 2024**

While participating **in the International Coins Conference**, we sought the opinions of high schoolers: **what do they think synthetic biology is?** After discussing the topic and addressing common misconceptions, we explained the concept of synthetic biology and conducted an iGEM simulation. During the activity, attendees presented problems, their proposed solutions, and the reasoning behind them. Much like the **Students for Pupils, Pupils for Students** initiative, our primary goal was to listen and address many myths about synthetic biology, while enriching our future communication strategies.

## **Sustainability Festival ‘Breathe In, Green Out’**

We were delighted to participate in this festival, where we explored ecological and responsible lifestyles through the lens of synthetic biology. We discussed the practical applications of synthetic biology in everyday life and its potential to address environmental challenges. Additionally, we invited **Evelina Prosevičiūtė**, last year's Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM team lead, to share insights from their project about bacterial glue. We also engaged attendees by asking them to identify the problems they would attempt to solve using synthetic biology. Our interactive activities focused on sustainability in the fashion industry, showcasing current innovations in synthetic biology.

## **The Association of Lithuanian Science Olympiads**

Collaboration with **the Association of Lithuanian Science Olympiads** enabled us to engage more young science enthusiasts. We partnered with them at the camp ‘**STEAM researchers**’ where we delivered lectures on cellular biology and astrobiology, prompting students to consider both the vastness of the cosmos and the complexity of cells. We were also invited to organize a round for **the Baltic States Olympiad Trivia**, providing us with an opportunity to challenge participants in the Olympiad in synthetic biology. This partnership enabled us to connect with motivated and inquisitive young people.

Furthermore, as part of our outreach efforts, we contributed an article to the **57th Lithuanian Biology Olympiad** newsletter, organized by **the Association of Lithuanian Science Olympiads**. In the article, we introduced readers to synthetic biology through the context of plastic pollution and discussed recent research on genetically engineered bacteria that accelerate the degradation of PET plastic. We highlighted how such innovations can transform environmental challenges into opportunities for sustainable solutions. By demonstrating how bacteria can be re-engineered to ‘eat’ plastic, we aimed to show that biology is not limited to textbooks, but is a dynamic field capable of reshaping our environment. For us, it was less about abstract inspiration and more about extending an invitation. We encouraged readers to explore opportunities in synthetic biology—through study, experimentation, or community projects—and to see themselves as future contributors to real-world breakthroughs.

Additionally, we developed an article analysis task for the **Society of Biologists (BioSa)**, a non-commercial initiative organized by **the Association of Lithuanian Science Olympiads**. In this project, high school students study biology at a more advanced level than their standard curriculum and prepare for national and international biology olympiads. For this activity, we selected the article “Evolution of a Minimal Cell” by R.Z. Moger-Reischer et al., published in “Nature” (2023). The article connects synthetic biology and evolution, fitting well with students' curriculum. We created a task consisting of ten multiple-choice questions and five sets of four true-or-false statements to evaluate students’ comprehension and analytical abilities. This demonstrates our commitment to developing innovative, research-driven learning experiences that deepen students’ understanding of scientific research and encourage them to actively participate in shaping the future of synthetic biology.

## **Summer Camps**

Synthetic biology draws upon the exploration of nature, making it essential to discuss both its origins and its ongoing advancements. To this end, we attended the **Scout camp ‘Let it Rise’,** where we organised educational activities outside, discussing science, the iGEM competition, and experimenting using thin-layer chromatography. At the ‘**Dream, Explore, Experiment, Discover, Model**’ camp, we led two sessions for children aged from 11 to 14\. First, we introduced them to iGEM, explained its background, and encouraged the pupils to identify and propose relevant problems and their solutions using science. The second session involved a hands-on laboratory activity, culminating in an acid-base experiment with everyday materials and red cabbage indicator. Additionally, we visited **the National Academy of Schoolchildren**, where students in grades 9 to 12 engaged in an ‘**Idea Laboratory**’—an iGEM simulation requiring them to address not only the problem and solution but also elements like Laboratory work, Human Practices, entrepreneurship, PR, and IT.

## **Vilnius University Alumni Festival**

One of our final activities was a collaboration with **Grow with Vilnius University** and a discussion **at the Vilnius University Alumni Festival*.*** Grow with Vilnius University was a lively event where children engaged with science through play. Our young scientists learned about bacteria, created their own, visualized them, and explained what they do. They also conducted the “elephant toothpaste” experiment. After our activities with the youngest members of the science community, our lab lead, **Povilas Kruopis**, participated in a discussion titled “**Biotechnology Today: From the First Enzymes to Genome Editing”**, focusing on biotechnology’s development from simple enzymatic tools to advanced genome-editing technologies. **The Vilnius University Alumni Festival** enabled us to bridge both ends of the scientific spectrum – a playful introduction to science for children and an in-depth discussion for the university community and alums.

# Introducing Synthetic Biology to University Students

## **Vilnius University Career Days** 

The Vilnius University Career Days provided us with an opportunity to deepen our understanding of how students envision their future paths in science. Through discussions, we aimed to highlight the various questions synthetic biology raises: how scientific research translates into real-world careers and how collaboration across different disciplines gives rise to new opportunities. For us, our primary goal for this event was to listen to students' perspectives on what excites or worries them about careers in the science fields. We gained insights that helped us to reflect on our own project and the development of our skills as emerging scientists.  

## **Where Debate Meets Discovery**

We collaborated with the **Vilnius University Debate Club** to organize discussions on real-life scenarios and challenges related to science in society. Before the debate, our Lab Lead, **Povilas Kruopis,** provided participants with an introduction to synthetic biology and its potential applications. The debaters then discussed two key questions: **whether it is ethically correct to genetically engineer children to prevent diseases, and whether synthetic biology should be used to revive extinct species.** What set this event apart was its multidisciplinary approach. The conversation extended beyond science to include ethical and cultural perspectives. Unlike traditional outreach, where we lead the discussion, this event encouraged a dynamic exchange among participants, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of the issues that mattered most to them.

## **Vilnius University Freshmen Camps**

Every year, Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM teams visit Vilnius University’s Freshman Camps—our mission is to demonstrate that science is inclusive and open to everyone, and that all groups can make meaningful contributions. This year, we attended the freshman camps at the Life Science Center and the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, where we introduced future scholars to our project, synthetic biology, and the numerous opportunities it offers.

## **Ad Astra Student Integration Festival**

At the sixth **‘Ad Astra’ Integration Festival**, organized by the VU Student Representation, we hosted two activities: a workshop introducing new Vilnius University students to iGEM, where participants addressed common dormitory challenges with synthetic biology, and an exhibition showcasing the achievements of previous Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM teams. Additionally, we presented our current project, highlighting its significance, and provided attendees with interactive games that allowed them to test their knowledge of synthetic biology and general science. Since many participants were unfamiliar with iGEM, we focused on providing clear explanations. This process enabled us to gain a better understanding of how others perceive our work and the competition in general. We enjoyed contributing to the university’s community-building efforts by welcoming students and enriching their experience into a shared culture, contributing to its history.

# Communication with the scientific community

## **Vilnius University Life Sciences Center Community Evening**

At the **Life Sciences Center Community Evening**, we spoke with the scientific community and professors in an informal setting. We encouraged discussions about synthetic biology and collected feedback on our project ideas. We also organized a trivia game, in which participants were presented with various scientific challenges and asked to guess whether an iGEM team had previously addressed each one. This allowed us to step outside of formal presentations and engage in meaningful conversations, testing how our ideas resonated with experts. For us, the evening was a feedback loop—an invaluable opportunity to refine IXPOSE and strengthen our connections with the broader LSC community.

## **Conference FEBS3+ Baltics: Biochemistry at the Fore Line**

The **FEBS3+ Baltics: Biochemistry at the Fore Line** conference united ecology, science, and cultural initiatives, enabling diverse communities to discuss ideas for a more responsible future directly. We presented a lecture on synthetic biology, highlighting how modern life sciences can advance sustainable practices. Attendees included researchers, environmentalists, and citizens committed to ecological lifestyles. The exchange demonstrated the potential of synthetic biology to foster innovation and promote environmental responsibility.

# Education without Barriers

Throughout September, our team partnered with **Prirašytos Rankos** (Written Hands) to bring the **“Science Around Us”** educational program to inmates in the Vilnius, Kaunas, and Šiauliai prisons. We introduced the basic scientific concepts, demonstrating their relevance to everyday life and their potential for solving real-world problems. These sessions sparked discussions about recent scientific discoveries, encouraged questions, and promoted collaborative problem-solving, illustrating that knowledge and curiosity are available to all, regardless of their past. The strong interest shown by participants highlights the value of sharing science's practical impact and fostering curiosity.

These visits were especially considering Lithuania’s challenging post-incarceration statistics. Annually, about **2,000** individuals are released from prisons, many of whom reoffend or struggle to reintegrate into society after time in prison \[1\]. However, those who receive gradual reentry support, as provided by pusiaukelės namai (halfway houses), experience significantly lower unemployment rates (about **6%**) and recidivism rates (about **8%**) compared to those released directly from harsher prison environments \[1\]. We aimed to contribute to rehabilitative, curiosity-nurturing environments modeled by halfway houses. The initiative aimed to foster dialogue, spark new interests, and support rehabilitation for inmates.
