# Introduction

In science, communication is never one-sided—it thrives on the exchange of ideas and opinions. This year, our team prioritized dialogue and interaction in our educational initiatives by collecting feedback and engaging with a diverse range of communities, from curious children to unexpected audiences, such as inmates. To steer our efforts, we created **BRIDGE**—a framework that reflects the core values education in synthetic biology and science should uphold:

**B – Building Understanding:** Making complex concepts accessible.  
**R – Real-World Relevance:** Demonstrating how (synthetic) biology impacts everyday life.  
**I – Inclusivity & Accessibility:** Ensuring that everyone, regardless of their background, could engage with science.  
**D – Dialogue & Engagement:** Encouraging discussion and collaborative learning.  
**G – Growth & Lifelong Learning:** Inspiring continued curiosity.  
**E – Education for Impact:** Fostering continuity and lasting change.

Through this framework, we promoted participation in various forms, including hands-on workshops, thought-provoking lectures and debates, scavenger hunts, hikes, quizzes, and interactive discussions. Each activity was designed not only to share knowledge but to start conversations and spark curiosity, making education an ongoing journey rather than a single event.

## The Life Trilogy: A Three-Part Experience

In our commitment to public education, we organized **The Life Trilogy**: a three-part series of events inviting diverse audiences to explore biology not only as a science, but also as a lens for understanding themselves and the world. By blending discussion, sensory experiences, and thought-provoking lectures, The Life Trilogy encouraged people from all backgrounds to engage with fundamental questions central to our mission: **how biology shapes identity, perception, and daily life.**

##### **GENESIS: Biology, DNA & Identity – What Lies Within?**

Our first event, **GENESIS: Biology, DNA & Identity – What Lies Within?**, explored the impact of genetics on human personality and questioned the extent to which DNA determines identity.

We hosted an open discussion led by **Dr. Rolandas Meškys** and moderated by our team. Attendees critically considered both the power and limitations of DNA in shaping individuality. The event challenged misconceptions—for instance, that personality is entirely dictated by genes—while explaining how environment, trauma, and personal experience, alongside genetics, influence it.

However, the discussion wasn’t the only activity. We also set up stations, inviting participants to unique experiences blending self-observation, creativity, and interaction. The journey began at the first station, *‘**Among Sounds**’.* Here*,* music served as a bridge to the inner world, expressing emotions that words often could not. Participants listened to melodies and chose colors reflecting the feelings evoked, then visualized their state of mind and attached these to the ‘sound wall.’  In *‘**The Room of Reflections**’*, participants met themselves through fragments of mirrors, observing their reflections without judgment or explanation, simply noticing bodily sensations, eyes, and breath. *‘**The Neuron Bride**’* celebrated the joy of connection: participants drew questions, posed them to strangers, and symbolized new bonds by weaving strings into a web of connection, creating a visual representation of interpersonal links. With *‘**Feel the Film**’*, participants were invited to explore how sound affects perception by watching the same film scene with different audio tracks, revealing shifts in bodily reactions and interpretations. At *‘**The Identity Archive**’,* attendees released limiting traits, truths, or labels that held them back by depositing them in an archive container, symbolically letting them go. The final station, *‘**Reflection Corner**’*, *fostered an* intuitive connection: participants selected a question from the wall, responded with a single word, and added it to a collective field of responses, forming a bridge between personal experience and shared reflection.

By presenting biology as both a technical subject and a human story, **GENESIS** connected synthetic biology to real-life questions about identity and ethics. The event deepened participants' understanding of how science relates to individual lives, supporting our goal to make molecular biology approachable, relevant, and socially responsible.

##### **ESSENCE: The Alchemy of Sense**

**ESSENCE**, the second event in our Life Trilogy series, explored how biology influences our experience of the world. While **GENESIS** investigated the hidden code of DNA, **ESSENCE** provided participants with direct contact with the molecular mechanics of the senses.

Before inviting the audience to experience their sensory systems in action, we began the event with an overview of human sensory biology and the evolution of taste and smell. We followed with a discussion on how these aspects can be complemented or modified by synthetic biology. After the introduction, we guided our guests to participate in the sense-bending activities.

**Taste manipulation**: Attendees sampled foods while certain senses were blocked or altered—such as tasting with eyes closed, with a pinched nose, or after changing the sensitivity of taste buds. They also tasted identical yogurts presented in different colors, discovering that many perceived different flavors purely due to the influence of sight and their own expectations. This demonstration highlighted the strong interplay between senses, emphasizing the significant role of smell, sight, and anticipation in flavor perception.

**Smell identification**: Participants used scented markers to guess hidden smells, sparking discussion about the complexity of olfactory receptors and the personal, subjective aspects of sensory experiences.

Through interactive activities, we enabled participants to discover the ‘alchemy’ of sensory biology in an enjoyable and lasting way, emphasizing how perception is influenced not only by our DNA-encoded receptors but also by context and environment.

**ESSENCE** transformed biology into an accessible and hands-on experience. The practical experiments provided valuable insights into the fundamental role of the senses and how personal views can influence perception. Participants left with a richer understanding of how molecules, context, and their own opinions interconnect—moving us forward in our mission to make science approachable and meaningful for everyone.

##### **BEYOND: Reimagining Perception**

As the final installment of our event series, **BEYOND: Reimagining Perception** invited participants to explore the biological foundations of consciousness and altered mental states. The event was held at the fascinating **Automobile Museum**. The choice of venue was intentional: the museum’s exhibition on the evolution of automobiles offered an opportunity for a parallel to the integration of synthetic biology in the automotive industry. Participants were also invited to see the former Vilnius taxi park, a building whose two spiral structures are reminiscent of DNA helices. After exploring the environment, attendees gathered for lectures that encouraged them to think about the intersections of biology, perception, emotion, and microbes.

Two main talks were featured:

- In **“The Biochemistry of Consciousness: What Causes Dreams and Visions?”** Dr. Ramunė Dirvanskienė examined the molecular and neural bases for dreams, hallucinations, and shifts in perception  
- Dr. Rūta Kananavičiūtė’s **“Bacteria That Shape Our Mood and Mind”** explored how the microbiome affects neurotransmitters, emotions, and thought patterns, emphasizing the hidden interaction between our microbes and the brain.

Hosting these discussions outside traditional scientific settings reinforced the idea that biology transcends the laboratory, intersecting with culture, art, and imagination. Participants were encouraged to reflect on perception itself: **To what extent does internal biology shape our reality, and to what degree do external context and culture influence it?**

Concluding the Life Trilogy, **BEYOND** left the audience with a renewed sense of wonder and curiosity about the living systems within and around them, as well as a new curiosity about the boundaries of biology, identity, and experience.

### **Reflection**

The three parts of The Life Trilogy form a cohesive narrative arc — from **DNA and identity** to **sensory experience**, **consciousness**, **and perception**. Through interactive and accessible formats, we expanded our reach beyond the laboratory, making synthetic biology and related sciences approachable, relevant, and thought-provoking. This event series not only educated our audience but also deepened our own understanding of how science can be creatively and meaningfully communicated.

## Project-Related Education

In addition to our broader educational initiatives, we focused on ***Ixodes ricinus***, **the central figure of our project.** Through engaging activities, we aimed to raise awareness about ticks and tick-borne diseases while **providing participants with practical knowledge to apply in their daily lives.**

**IXPOSE the Threat** guided participants through a series of educational stations, each revealing a different aspect of the tick issue. The journey began by challenging myths and clarifying facts about ticks, breaking down common misconceptions. Another highlighted prevention, demonstrating how appropriate clothing choices can reduce exposure risk. Participants also received a step-by-step guide for safe tick removal and learned that prompt action is crucial. The program concluded with an insightful talk by immunologist **Prof. Aurelija Žvirblienė** on vaccine development for tick-borne diseases, followed by an overview of our project and its scientific goals.

During the **(De)code Nature** event, we organized a hike where the natural environment became an outdoor classroom. **Dr. Vilmantas Pupkis** and **Dr. Miglė Tomkuvienė** shared their expertise and answered questions live. By combining scientific discussion with direct engagement with nature, we enabled participants to connect abstract biological concepts to the environment they inhabit, emphasizing both the dangers of ticks and the importance of biodiversity.
