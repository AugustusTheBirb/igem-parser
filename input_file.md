# Introduction

**Vector-borne disease is resurging both in Europe and globally, posing an increasing public health challenge** \[1\]. This trend is driven by climate change, globalization, and ecological disruptions that alter **interactions between humans, animals, and disease vectors** \[2\]. Vectors, mainly blood-feeding insects and ticks, can transmit various pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and protozoa \[3\]. **Ticks represent the most significant vectors of human and animal pathogens in Europe, transmitting more infections than any other arthropod** \[4\]. Approximately 70 tick species are found in Europe, primarily grouped into the Argasidae (soft ticks) and Ixodidae (hard ticks) families \[5\]. Hard ticks, notably *Ixodes ricinus*, are responsible for the transmission of most tick-borne diseases (TBDs), such as tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV), *Borrelia burgdorferi* (*sensu lato)*, *Babesia divergens*, and *Anaplasma phagocytophilum* \[6\]. The burden of TBDs is closely tied to human behavior \[7\]. International travel further facilitates the spread of vector-borne diseases, heightening pandemic risks \[8\]. Climate change, manifesting as warmer temperatures, shorter winters, and longer spring and autumn seasons, has extended the tick activity periods \[6\], while land use changes and urbanization increase human exposure \[9\]. Notably, the distribution of *I. ricinus* expanded significantly across Europe between 2017 and 2023, highlighting escalating risks \[10\]. **Consequently, controlling TBDs has become a significant public health challenge in the 21st century** \[6\].

# Tick-borne disease monitoring

**Effective TBD monitoring is crucial for developing public health strategies.** Surveillance often entails systematically recording human cases through reports from general practitioners or infectious disease specialists \[11\]. However, most TBDs are not under mandatory surveillance at the European level, mainly due to the disease’s heterogeneity and their wide distribution \[11\]. Case definitions also differ significantly between countries, reflecting varying epidemiological conditions, diagnostic resources, and national health priorities \[11\]. Where systematic surveillance is absent or inefficient, cases may be tracked retrospectively through bibliographic analyses, hospital databases, or surveys. However, these methods are prone to underestimation, and cases of overdiagnosis or misdiagnosis may go unreported. In such situations, apparent increases in reported cases may reflect heightened awareness or improved diagnostic capacity rather than an actual rise in disease incidence \[12\], \[13\].

Since the epidemiology of TBDs is closely linked to vector distribution, entomological data provide a complementary monitoring strategy \[11\]. For example, the Vbornet network has produced maps of major TBDs in Europe, utilizing expert input as well as climatic, ecological, and human factors that affect the distribution of *I. ricinus* \[14\]. To assess the risk of tick-borne pathogen (TBP) transmission, most surveillance studies rely on detecting pathogens in field-collected ticks \[15\]. Ticks can be collected from vegetation, using dragging or flagging techniques to capture questing ticks, or directly from hosts to obtain engorged individuals \[16\], \[17\]. The choice of collection method influences the tick life stages and species recovered, and must be tailored to the research question \[17\]. However, environmental contaminants adhering to tick cuticles can interfere with pathogen detection, and standardized protocols for decontamination are still lacking \[18\]. The first step in pathogen detection is tissue disruption, which can be achieved through mechanical or chemical methods, depending on the tick family and life stage \[17\], \[19\]. Hard ticks, such as *Ixodes ricinus* in our case, often require physical disruption due to their chitin-rich tegument, while soft ticks are processed more easily. Once disrupted, nucleic acids are extracted for downstream analysis \[19\], \[20\]. DNA is typically used for bacterial and protozoan pathogens, while RNA is required for tick-borne viruses and assessing pathogen viability \[21\]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remains the cornerstone of TBP detection. Conventional PCR provides rapid and cost-effective results, while nested PCR and quantitative PCR (qPCR) improve sensitivity and specificity \[22\], \[23\], \[24\]. Sequencing is commonly used for confirmation, strain identification, and phylogenetic analysis \[25\]. However, single-pathogen approaches are limited when co-infections occur, as overlapping amplification can complicate interpretation \[17\].

# Situation in the Baltics

The situation in the Baltic States, particularly Lithuania, is equally concerning. ***I. ricinus*** **is widespread across Lithuania and now commonly found not just in forests but also in urban green spaces, especially parks** \[26\]. One study found that 56,4% of TBEV patients were infected close to home \[27\]. Further research shows that infected ticks are more active, aggressive, less susceptible to repellents, and encounter humans more frequently \[28\]. According to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 3212 cases of TBEV were reported in European countries in 2018, with 608 cases from Baltic countries. Lithuania had the highest notification rate per 100,000 people (13.7), followed by Slovenia (7.4), the Czech Republic (6.7), Estonia (6.4), and Latvia (5.2). Between 2003 and 2018, Lithuania accounted for 52.23% of all TBEV cases reported in the Baltic region (n \= 13,600 cases). In 2023, the National Public Health Centre in Lithuania also documented a surprising 15,254 cases of Lyme disease — a fivefold increase from 2,896 cases the previous year. Entomologist Milda Žygutienė attributed this sharp rise more to changes in reporting and diagnostics than to an increase in tick infection rates \[29\]. Additionally, while other TBDs are not currently monitored in Lithuania, mapping risks is essential given the high prevalence of these diseases. **Significant data gaps remain in several regions, including Lithuania, underscoring the urgent need for coordinated surveillance systems to evaluate the spread of tick-borne diseases more effectively**. This is where our project has a critical role.

# IXPOSE – a solution to the problem

Our team’s primary goal is to help **IXPOSE the threat early.** We are developing a breakthrough tool, powered by an innovative TIGR-Tas system, **designed to accurately and cost-effectively detect DNA from any TBP.** Our product can accelerate the tick testing process, enabling scientists to identify infections more quickly, track the spread of tick-borne pathogens**, and take timely action to prevent outbreaks**.

The developed tool integrates several key components, including **recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)** and the newly discovered RNA-guided DNA-targeting **TIGR-Tas** **system** \[30\], within a **lateral flow assay (LFA)** test strip. RPA is an isothermal, highly sensitive method for DNA amplification, making it well-suited for field use. Unlike CRISPR-Cas, the TIGR-Tas system does not require a PAM sequence, enabling it to target nearly any DNA sequence. This test could enhance TBD monitoring by improving detection and increasing data accuracy, both of which are vital for advancing solutions to increasing TBD risks.

**TESTUKO VIZULKĖ**

A crucial element in creating a functional LFA was the **connectase enzyme**. Connectase is a **protein ligase** that enables specific protein labeling in complex buffers with 100**% yield** \[31\], \[32\]. The peptide tag recognized by connectase can be utilised for a myriad of purposes, such as creating protein conjugates, attaching proteins to surfaces and beads, and introducing beneficial chemical modifications, including biotin, digoxigenin, fluorophores, or other functional chemical groups. 

# Conclusion

We’re addressing the gaps in tick-borne disease monitoring by improving detection, increasing data accuracy, and raising awareness about their impact on human health. Effective monitoring is crucial for developing public health strategies, enabling targeted vaccination programs, enhancing diagnostic and treatment tools, optimizing the allocation of healthcare resources, and strengthening overall prevention and response efforts–empowering both researchers and healthcare professionals to **IXPOSE the threat before it spreads.**
