<H2 id="heading 0">Software</H2>
<P>When our team faced a setback due to a spectrophotometer malfunction that abruptly halted our experiments, we realized just how critical time management is. That is why we developed the RGBradford assay software, which can detect protein concentration using a phone’s camera. As accurate as a standart spectrophotometer, our software provides teams with a fast solution. All information about our RGBradford assay application is available on the <Link href="https://2025.igem.wiki/vilnius-lithuania/software/">Software</Link> page.</P>
<H2 id="heading 1">Hardware</H2>
<P>To make protein electrophoresis easier for future iGEM teams, we created a simple electrophoresis chamber. Our goal is to provide an easy-to-build, open-source foundation for vertical electrophoresis experiments. To help everyone interested, we’ve provided detailed assembly instructions, 3D files, and a materials list. To learn more about our vision and thought process behind this idea, visit our <Link href="https://2025.igem.wiki/vilnius-lithuania/hardware/">Hardware</Link> page.</P>
<H2 id="heading 2">Experiment Booklet ‘Science In Your Hands’</H2>
<P>To make science more inclusive and accessible, our team created the experiment booklet, ‘Science In Your Hands’, designed to bridge the gap between science and the general public. The booklet introduces fundamental science and biology concepts, featuring 24 experiments that can be conducted at home or in classrooms without costly laboratory equipment. We aim to demonstrate that science is not limited to scientists only. Our team encourages other iGEM teams to build upon the provided material freely and translate it into different languages, making science even more accessible. The booklet is available in our <Link href="https://2025.igem.wiki/vilnius-lithuania/inclusivity/">Inclusivity</Link> section.</P>
